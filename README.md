# 🐠 Goldfish Feed

Goldfish Feed is a simple, browser-based activity feed for Twitch streamers who find themselves forgetting who they've thanked when they get lost in the 'Faff' of it all.

## How to use
1. Go to the [Live Link Here](https://tgalimberti.github.io/goldfish-feed)
2. Click **Connect with Twitch**.
3. Keep the tab open on your second monitor while you stream.
4. When an event happens, it lights up.
5. Simply click the event to mark it as "Done" to turn it grey.

## Features
- **Twitch-native:** Works with follows, subs, gift subs, cheers, channel point redeems, and raids.
- **Customisable:** Choose which events appear, and toggle between "Minimal" or "Full Color" high-contrast modes.
- **Client-side only:** No downloads - runs entirely in-browser.
- **Secure:** Your token never leaves your browser.

## To-do
- Upgrade to PKCE flow (preventing unnecessary login each time)
- Include donations via 3rd-parties like streamlabs and streamelements

## Limitations
- Because this is a live feed, it doesn't show events that occurred *before* you open the link.
